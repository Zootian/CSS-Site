      <h3>Automation Testing</h3>
      <p>For 2 years, I worked for Cognizant Technology Solutions and Infosys as a Quality Analyst and Engineer. I wrote scripts to automate functional testing for web and mobile apps.</p>

      <h3>Web App Design and Development</h3>
      <p class="autoDesc">When I was 20 years old I knew I wanted to learn coding so I could eventually develop my own web apps, and eventually convert them to mobile Apps via an Ionic Shell.
        I figured teaching myself would be a good experiment, which only got me so far; that's when I invested in a Web App FullStack Development Course from Udemy, by Angela Yu. This was the second project from her course.</p>

      <h3>Lifelong Chef</h3>
      <p>I started cooking when I was 10 years old because I had spent a lot of time with my Grandmother, Grams, when I was young and she often had the food network on. Since then, my adventurous palate has taken me around the world, inlcuding Mysore, India and Seoul, South Korea. </p>
